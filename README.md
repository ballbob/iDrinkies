# iDrinkies: the stockist finder

A full-stack web app, made in a group of 3 people, to find and display sources of booze using javascript, mongoDB and a local API. 

This project aimed to create a simple web app to find and locate stockists of a made-up drinks company using a Google map and a list of the places it locates. The 'story' is that a drinks company wants to show its followers its stockists - since Google maps will already give you branches of a pub or shop, *and* sources of a type of product, we wanted an app that would find something Google wouldn't.

A local API contains the details and locations of each pub. The web app itself takes this data and uses it to populate HTML elements with details from the API. It populates a Google Map with markers that expand into info windows and expand the drop-down info for the pub HTML elements.
